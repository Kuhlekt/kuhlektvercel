              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
              <p className="mb-3">
                We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, 
                submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit 
                information is transmitted using the latest 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology and then 
                encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special 
                access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3">
                256-bit SSL encryption is approximated to take at least one trillion years to break, and is the industry standard. 
                If you have any questions regarding our security policy, please contact our support@kuhlekt.com Processing of 
                payments occurs using 3rd party payment gateways and as such, your credit card information is never stored on our servers.
